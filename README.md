# portfolio
Hi! My name is Jonathan Attanasio and this is my portfolio of work spanning multiple programming languages. My projects/programs will be divided by primary language and then each of those will have the associated files and a ReadME file documenting what I learned and any reflection before, during and after development. I hope you enjoy!
