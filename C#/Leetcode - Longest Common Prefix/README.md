## Intuition
For this I wanted to make sure that I maintained the fact that the prefix can't be longer than the shortest word. Hence, the checks for blanks and Math.Min determining the amount of times the for loop checks.

## Approach
Using the .Substring accessor it was really easy to refill prefix without using an array or any list; However, I did evaluate those as options I saw this nested looping as a better option.

## Complexity
Time complexity:
1ms; ran out of freemium analyses.

Space complexity:
